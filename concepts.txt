Git --> a version control software

Github --> a website that allows you to perform version control into the files you are working on

Repository or Repo --> is a project that can have one or more files inside 

Commit --> is a "screenshot" of your code at a specific time. Think of a commit as a "Save" that you apply to the file.

Hash --> is a unique id of each commit you've made

Fork --> is the act of "copying" the repository of someone else into your account. If user2 likes the x repository of user1
and wants to keep writing or improving its code, he can fork x and work separately on the code without "damaging" it.

Branches --> you can think of them as different rails(tracks) of code. Let's say you want to make some changes to a certain file of the repo but you're not sure if this is a good idea - you don't know if you are going to keep these changes in the future or not. In order to avoid a normal(commit) you create a new branch(code experiment). Later on if you decide that this experiment was a good idea, you can merge the changes to the master branch of your repo.

Git vs Gists --> Gists are part of GitHub and they are used generally when you want to share code snippets, pices of code,
teach techniques, etc. So in all the cases that it won't make sense to create an entire repository for sharing just a small piece of code that has a specific function. On the other hand GitHub shares an entire repository(project) with the World and the repo generally will have multiple files and a more complex structure.
