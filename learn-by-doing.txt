Learning by implementing these tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV

-------Tutorial 1-------

Created the repository "Learn-Github"
Added the file called concepts.txt 
Added some content into concepts.txt
Commited the new file
Made a change into the file by adding the concept of Fork
Commited the change
Used the SUPER POWER of Git. On Learn-Github I clicked on concepts.txt and then on the button that appeared called History
I was able to see the changes that were made in the last commit
New lines that are added in the last commit are highlighted in green and have a + sign in front of the line
While lines that were edited or removed appear highlighted in red and have the - sign in front of them
Also while in this commit screen I could see the unique ID of the commit. This string of letter and numbers is called Commit Hash. You can see the same string appear in the URL as well!


-------Tutorial 2-------

Go to the Learn-Github repo, then --> learn-by-doing.txt
Underneath the Code menu item you'll see a button that says Branch: master
Click on it. Now you'll be able to create a new branch, name it Tutorial 2
Automatically the current branch you're in will change to Branch: tutorial-2
Start experimenting. Add the steps of Tutorial 2 in learn-by-doing.txt
Afterwards add a comment for the "Commit changes" section
Select "Commit directly to the Tutorial-2 branch"
The second option assumes that after doing the editing you realize that this branch was a GREAT IDEA, 
so it's better to start merging this branch with the master branch.
Click the "Commit changes" button.
