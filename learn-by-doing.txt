-------Tutorial 1-------

Created the repository "Learn-Github"
Added the file called concepts.txt 
Added some content into concepts.txt
Commited the new file
Made a change into the file by adding the concept of Fork
Commited the change
Used the SUPER POWER of Git. On Learn-Github I clicked on concepts.txt and then on the button that appeared called History
I was able to see the changes that were made in the last commit
New lines that are added in the last commit are highlighted in green and have a + sign in front of the line
While lines that were edited or removed appear highlighted in red and have the - sign in front of them
Also while in this commit screen I could see the unique ID of the commit. This string of letter and numbers is called Commit Hash.
